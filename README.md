# Elevate-Labs-T6 - Creating strong passwords

## Tips to create a Strong Password:

1.	Use at least 12 characters.
2.	Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3.	Avoid dictionary words, names, and repeated patterns.
4.	Don’t use predictable sequences like 123, abc, or !@#.
5.	Place symbols or numbers or capital letters within the password, not just at the ends.
6.	Never reuse passwords across multiple sites.

## Common Password Attacks:

1. Brute Force Attack: An attack involving systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. Attackers use automated tools or scripts to try millions or billions of combinations rapidly.
2. Dictionary Attack: An attack that uses a list of common words, names, and previously leaked passwords to guess a password.  Instead of trying every combination, the tool used here, tests words that are likely to be used as passwords like password, letmein, etc.
3. Credential Stuffing: An attack that reuses leaked usernames and passwords from previous data breaches.
4. Hybrid Attack: It is the combination of dictionary and brute force attack.
5. Rainbow Table Attack: Most companies store passwords in hashed form. This attack uses precomputed tables of hash–password pairs found from previous data breaches, to quickly reverse hashes and discover the original passwords.

## How Password Complexity Affects Security

- Password strength depends on its entropy .i.e the total number of possible combinations it could be.
- A password made up of only lowercase letters (a–z) has 26 choices per character. So, an 8-character lowercase password has 26^8 possibilities.
- But if you use uppercase and lowercase alphabets along with numbers and special characters, you can get around 95 possible characters. So, now an 8-character lowercase password has 95^8 possibilities.
- Password Length is critical as each additional character exponentially increases the number of possible combinations.
- The time to crack a password grows exponentially with its length and the size of the character set.
- Brute force tools take longer to crack complex passwords.
- Dictionary attacks are ineffective when you don’t use real words.
